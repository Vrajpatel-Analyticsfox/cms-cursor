1. Purpose of this Document

The purpose of the Data Ingestion Workflow is to define a standardized, scalable, and auditable process for acquiring structured data from various internal and external sources (manual uploads, APIs, SFTP, batch systems) into the organization's data platform. This ingestion pipeline ensures data consistency, quality validation, traceability, and readiness for downstream consumption such as reporting, analytics, and operational automation.
Objective
1. Automate and streamline the process of importing data from multiple sources.
2. Enforce data validation rules to ensure data integrity.
3. Maintain a complete audit trail of ingestion activities for compliance and traceability.
4. Provide error handling and real-time notifications on ingestion success or failure.
5. Support both batch-based and real-time data ingestion mechanisms.
6. Ensure seamless integration with monitoring and alerting systems.


2. Entities:
EntityDescriptionIngestion TriggerSystem, scheduler, or user action that initiates the ingestion process.Source SystemExternal or internal system that provides the data (e.g., CRM, DWH, API).Ingestion EngineCore module responsible for parsing, validation, and processing of the data.ParserComponent that transforms raw input into structured format (JSON, CSV, XML etc).ValidatorApplies business and data quality rules to ensure correctness of incoming data.Ingestion Log DBStores metadata and event logs related to ingestion attempts and status.Error HandlerManages validation or system errors; captures and logs them for follow-up.Notification ServiceSends alerts/emails to stakeholders on ingestion status (success/failure).StakeholdersUsers or systems notified about ingestion outcomes (Ops, Support, Business etc).Monitoring DashboardInterface to track ingestion performance, errors, retries, and KPIs.


3. Workflow:


Data Format: file format

DescriptionThis use case describes how data is ingested into the system via two primary channels - (1) Manual Upload of Excel/CSV files through a web interface, and (2) Scheduled SFTP-based Batch Upload from external systems. The system will parse, validate, log, and notify stakeholders post ingestion.Related Use Case IDUC001Pre - Condition * File schemas must be predefined and approved
* Upload and SFTP credentials are active
* Validation rules are pre-configured
* UI and SFTP listeners are operational
Flow of EventsPath A: Manual Upload

3. System parses the file and validates data
4. Success/failure summary is displayed
5. Audit log is updated
6. Stakeholders notified
Path B: SFTP Batch Upload
1. External system drops file at SFTP location
2. Scheduler picks up file at scheduled intervals
3. File is parsed and validated automatically
4. System logs ingestion status
5. Error or success message is logged

* Monitoring dashboard reflects ingestion status
Alternative Flow* If column headers do not match, allow admin user to map fields via UI

Exceptional Flow* Upload fails due to timeout or invalid format → system logs the event and alerts admin
* SFTP file missing during scheduled check → alert is sent to technical team
PriorityHighNon-Functional Requirement* Upload/Sync must complete within 1 minute for 10,000 records
* Retry mechanism for failed SFTP sync (up to 3 times)
* Secure encrypted transmission (SFTP/HTTPS)

* Rules Configuration Admin
* Validation Engine
* Notification Service
* Audit Log System
DescriptionThis use case enables automated validation of incoming data (via manual upload, SFTP, or API) based on pre-defined rule sets. The engine applies field-level, relational, and conditional validations to ensure data consistency, accuracy, and completeness before ingestion into the database.Related Use Case IDUC001, UC004Pre - Condition * Data file (CSV/Excel/API batch) is received by ingestion engine

3. Validation Engine loads rule set based on source/scheme
4. Each record is validated for:
* Mandatory fields
* Data types
* Format compliance (e.g., date, email)
* Referential integrity (e.g., master tables)
* Custom business rules (e.g., age > 18, amount > 0)
5. Validation results are categorized into:
* Pass
* Fail (with error code/message)
6. Success and error logs are written
7. Notification sent to stakeholders (if errors > threshold)
8. Processed file sent to next stage (success queue / error queue)

* System crash during validation → retry once, then fail and log
PriorityHighNon-Functional Requirement* Should validate 10,000 records in < 60 seconds
* Error rate threshold alerting (e.g., > 5% failure triggers email)
* Real-time validation UI feedback for manual uploads
* Logs retained for minimum 90 days

CMS modules are instrumented for event publishing.Flow of Events
1. CMS performs action (API call, upload, ingestion, retry, sync)
2. Action triggers log/event/metric
3. Data pushed to monitoring sink (e.g., via webhook or agent)
4. Monitoring system stores, analyzes, and visualizes data
5. Alerts triggered if thresholds are breached
6. Infra/Admins notifiedFields and ValidationLog Event Schema for Monitoring Integration

Post - ConditionObservability layer receives logs and metrics; dashboards and alerts reflect live system healthAlternative Flow- CMS batches non-critical logs and pushes every X minutes
- For mobile clients, limited telemetry is pushed during syncExceptional Flow- Monitoring endpoint unreachable → event buffered and retried
- Log format invalid → rejected and flaggedPriorityHighNon-Functional Requirement- Logging should not impact core CMS performance
- Event push latency < 2 sec
- 99.9% uptime for metrics pipelineAssumption and Dependency- Monitoring tool integrated (e.g., ELK, Datadog, Grafana)
- Events are schema-compliant and system clocks syncedAPI to be Integrated

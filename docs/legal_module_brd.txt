Flow of Events

Configuration for ID format must be enabled in system

identified using a standardized, auto-generated Case ID. This enables
accurate case referencing, audit trail maintenance, traceability, and
avoids manual duplication errors.
1. Detect new case

3. Increment sequence
4. Combine to form case ID
Case ID Format Options:
The recommended Case ID format can be configured, but the
standard format is:
Case ID Format:
LC-[YYYYMMDD]-[BranchCode or LoanTypeCode]-[SequenceNo]
Example: LC-20250721-MIC-0023
Where:


LC = Legal Case (prefix)



YYYYMMDD = Date of case creation



MIC = Loan Type Code or Branch Code (e.g., MIC for
Microfinance, CON for Consumer Loan)



0023 = Incremental numeric sequence, auto-reset daily (or
globally unique if preferred)

Case ID Generation Triggers:
 Auto-generated when the “Create Legal Case” form is
successfully submitted.
 If form creation is canceled before saving, the ID is not
reserved.
 Sequence count is maintained in a backend reference table.
